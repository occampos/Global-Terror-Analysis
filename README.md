# Global Terrorism Analysis

Project Description:

The Data Cleaning and Visualization Dashboard project is a comprehensive data analytics initiative aimed at transforming raw, messy data into insightful visualizations for enhanced decision-making. The project utilizes SQL for data cleaning, transformation, and preparation, while Power BI is employed to create a dynamic and interactive dashboard that presents the data in a visually appealing and informative manner.

Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to extract valuable insights from complex and unstructured datasets by employing robust data cleaning techniques using SQL and presenting the processed data through intuitive visualizations using Power BI.

Key Phases:

Data Assessment and Collection:
In this initial phase, the project team identifies and gathers diverse datasets from various sources, which may include databases, spreadsheets, or external data feeds. Understanding the characteristics and structure of the data is essential for designing an effective data cleaning and visualization strategy.

Data Cleaning with SQL:
SQL is used as the primary tool for data cleaning and transformation. The team leverages SQL queries to identify and handle missing or incorrect data, remove duplicates, and perform necessary data type conversions. Cleaning the data ensures that the subsequent visualizations are accurate and reliable.

Data Integration and Transformation:
The cleaned data may be scattered across multiple sources, requiring integration to form a coherent dataset. SQL joins and unions are applied to combine the relevant data, making it ready for further processing and analysis. Data transformation is also performed at this stage to create new derived attributes that may be useful in visualizations.

Data Preparation and Aggregation:
SQL queries are used to aggregate and summarize the data, preparing it for visualization. This step involves calculating key metrics, applying filters, and arranging the data into a format suitable for Power BI's visualizations.

Power BI Dashboard Creation:
Power BI, a powerful business intelligence tool, is utilized to build an interactive dashboard that showcases the insights gained from the cleaned and prepared data. The dashboard includes a variety of visualizations, such as charts, graphs, tables, and maps, all of which can be customized and interconnected for comprehensive analysis.

Dashboard Interactivity and User-Friendliness:
The Power BI dashboard is designed to be interactive, allowing users to explore the data from different perspectives. Filters, slicers, and drill-down features enable users to gain deeper insights and answer specific questions, enhancing the overall user experience.

Report Generation and Sharing:
Once the dashboard is complete, the project team generates reports summarizing the data findings and the methods used for data cleaning and visualization. These reports are shared with stakeholders and decision-makers, providing them with actionable insights derived from the processed data.

Benefits:

Enhanced data quality through rigorous SQL-based data cleaning.
Improved decision-making through intuitive and interactive visualizations.
Accessible insights for stakeholders, promoting data-driven actions.
Time-saving and efficient data preparation using SQL and Power BI automation.
The successful execution of this project empowers the organization with a comprehensive data analytics tool that transforms complex data into meaningful visualizations, enabling better strategic planning, data-driven decision-making, and improved business performance.
