# Global Terrorism Analysis

*Project Description:*

  The project manipulates a dataset regarding Terror Attacks across the globe. SQL Server is utilized for data cleaning, transformation, and preparation, while Power BI is employed to create a dynamic and interactive dashboard that presents the data in a visually appealing and informative manner.

*Objective:*

The primary objective of this project is to extract valuable insights from an unstructured dataset by employing data cleaning techniques using SQL and presenting the processed data through intuitive visualizations using Power BI.

*Key Phases:*
+ Initial Data Review in Excel:

The process begins by utilizing Excel to roughly isolate pertinent information from a vast dataset, which is later imported into SQL Server for further analysis and processing.

+ Data Cleaning with SQL in SQL Server:

SQL Server is used as the primary tool for data cleaning and transformation. SQL queries are leveraged to identify and handle missing or incorrect data, remove duplicates, and perform necessary data type conversions. SQL is also used to prepare data into a format suitable for Power BI's visualizations. The data is structured into multiple dimension and fact tables, establishing a star schema within Power BI. This schema design optimizes data and enables efficient data analysis. Cleaning and preparing the data ensures that the subsequent visualizations are accurate and reliable.

SQL queries are also used for data visualization validation. Visuals are created within Power BI and are verified corresponding SQL queries in SQL server to ensure accuracy and consistency.

+ Power BI Dashboard Creation:

Power BI, a powerful business intelligence tool, is utilized to build an interactive adn dynamic dashboard that showcases the insights gained from the cleaned and prepared data. Tables are used to aggregate and summarize the data, creating visualization. This step involves calculating measures, applying filters, and arranging the data into a format suitable for Power BI's visualizations. The dashboard includes a variety of visualizations, such as charts, graphs, and tables.

The Power BI dashboard is designed to be interactive, allowing users to explore the data from different perspectives. Filters, slicers, and drill-down features enable users to gain deeper insights and answer specific questions, enhancing the overall user experience.


*Benefits:*

- Enhanced data quality through rigorous SQL-based data cleaning.
- Time-saving and efficient data preparation using SQL and Power BI automation.
- Improved inisght regarding global terrorism through intuitive, dynamic, and interactive visualizations.
- The successful execution of this project highlights the ability to use comprehensive data analytics tools that transforms complex data into meaningful visualizations, enabling better strategic planning, data-driven decision-making, and improved business performance.
