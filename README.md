# Global Terrorism Analysis

*Project Description:*

  This project manipulates a dataset focused on Terror Attacks across the globe. **SQL Server** is utilized for data cleaning, transformation, and preparation, while **Power BI** is employed to create a dynamic and interactive dashboard that presents the data in a visually appealing and informative manner.

*Objective:*

The primary objective of this project is to extract valuable insights from an unstructured dataset by employing data cleaning techniques using **SQL** in **SQL Server** and presenting the processed data through intuitive visualizations using **DAX** in **Power BI**.

*Key Phases:*
+ Initial Data Review in Excel: The process begins by utilizing Excel to roughly isolate pertinent information from a vast dataset, which is later imported into SQL Server for further analysis and processing.

+ Data Cleaning with SQL in SQL Server: Queries are leveraged to identify and handle missing or incorrect data, remove duplicates, and perform necessary data type conversions. Data is prepared into a format suitable for Power BI's visualizations. The data is structured into multiple dimension and fact tables, establishing a star schema within Power BI. This schema design optimizes data and enables efficient data analysis. Cleaning and preparing the data ensures that the subsequent visualizations are accurate and reliable.

+ Power BI Dashboard Creation: This step involves manipulating the prepared data with DAX in Power BI, creating measures to build visualizations. The dashboard includes a variety of visualizations, such as charts, graphs, and tables. The design is interactive which gives the opportunity for users to explore the data from different perspectives. Filters, slicers, and drill-down features enable users to gain deeper insights and answer specific questions, enhancing the overall user experience. SQL queries are used for data visualization validation. Visuals are verified against corresponding SQL queries in SQL Server to ensure accuracy and consistency.
